MVC Bootcamp
============

#OVERVIEW

Need to get up to speed on ASP.NET MVC2 to write your next application? In this workshop we’ll drill down on the different pieces that make up this presentation pattern as well as cover other tools and frameworks that help mainstream ASP.NET MVC development. Also, during the workshop we’ll build a full working URL shortening application, miniUrl, that can be used for reference or profit! Whether you’re new to MVC2 or already have played with the bits, this session is worth checking out.
